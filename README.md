# Spotify_API

- Feature distributions in [psychedelic][folk]
  - Produce violin plot
- Is the playlist “coeherent”?
  i.e., are the songs contained in it “closer” in some terms than randomly selected songs? To test this, we could follow different approaches:
  - How does the distance among the songs in [psychedelic][folk] compare to all other playlists of my user? (lil Chris also has many playlists that we could use for comparison)
  - How does the distance among the songs compare to a random set of songs on spotify?
    - [ ] How do we get a random set of songs?
  - [ not strictly addressing the question] Can we identify any subcluster in the playlist? and what features make it “stand apart”? For example, there could be a more acoustic subgroup or a subgroup with higher valence.
    - Is there a relationship between subgrouping of the playlist and added date?
- Extend the analysis to other playlists
- Temporal trends of my listening activities in terms of features
- Machine learning projects (just pitches)
  - [hard] Use history of favourite songs to recommend what to listen to next using LSTM neural network
